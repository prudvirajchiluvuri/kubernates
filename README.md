# Kubernetes

* The word **Kubernetes** originated from Greek, meaning **"pilot"**.
* It is also called **K8s**.
* It was originally developed by Google.

## Why Containers Are Needed in Production

* Containers are needed in production environments.
* If one container stops, wouldn’t it be easier to automatically start another one?
* Kubernetes helps with:

  * Scaling
  * Failover
  * High availability

# Features of Kubernetes

1. **Service Discovery and Load Balancing**

   * Distributes network traffic across containers.

2. **Storage Orchestration**

   * Allows storage from:

     * Local storage
     * Cloud providers
     * Network storage systems

3. **Automated Rollouts and Rollbacks**

   * Automatically updates applications.
   * Rolls back if something fails.

4. **Automatic Bin Packing**

   * Efficiently places containers based on resource requirements.

5. **Self-Healing**

   * Restarts failed containers.
   * Replaces unhealthy Pods.

6. **Secret and Configuration Management**

   * Manages sensitive information securely.

7. **Batch Execution**

   * Runs batch jobs and scheduled tasks.

8. **Horizontal Scaling**

   * Scale applications up or down automatically.

9. **IPv4/IPv6 Dual Stack Support**

   * Supports both IPv4 and IPv6 for Pods and Services.

# Kubernetes Architecture Components

## Control Plane Components

### API Server

* Serves the Kubernetes APIs.
* Entry point for all cluster communication.

### etcd

* Key-value store.
* Stores cluster data processed by the API server.

### kube-controller-manager

* Ensures the current state matches the desired state.

### Scheduler

* Schedules Pods to run on nodes.

### Cloud Controller Manager

* Connects Kubernetes with external cloud providers.

---

# Node Components

* A **Node** is a machine (physical or virtual).

## Pods

* A **Pod** is a group of containers.
* Containers inside a Pod:

  * Share the same network
  * Share storage

---

# Command-Line and Networking Components

### kubectl

* Used to control and manage the cluster.
* Sends commands to the API server.

### kube-proxy

* Handles networking rules on nodes.
* Acts like a network traffic manager (not exactly a firewall).

If you'd like, I can also correct and polish it into **interview-ready notes** with clearer technical wording.
